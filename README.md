<h3> A URL Redirection Chrome Extension </h3>


This Chrome Extension redirects all pages a user tries to visit
to a specified page.

I have disguised it as a Google Drive Extension.

You can either install it by loading it as an unpacked extension
by just using the .json file and JavaScript file. 

Or you can use the packaged version of the extension by loading
the .crx file.  To do this you must drag the file onto the extension
page in Chrome.

I will be posting a link to a video tutorial on how to install this
extension on your friend's computer without them knowing soon.

Have fun. :)
